They get to spend time with adults who care.</p><p>VAP recognises that the real power of sport is its power to mobilize, to\nconnect, to inspire.</p><p>Enouce and his partner Nancy built all this from nothing. Well, okay, twenty\nyears of sweat and toil and giving a damn and strategic partnerships and\nfundraising and dreaming big, oh so big. But on this small patch of earth,\nEnouce is building a base to shelter kids and help them build better lives for\nthemselves.</p><p>This is grassroots aid, Kenyans helping Kenyans.</p><p>And they're not even close to stopping.

That's the\nbest bit.</p><p>The AkiraChix HQ hosts us for our working conference. They are a sort of a\nsister organisation for us as we are both funded (in part) by the Patrick J.\nMcGovern Foundation and Steele Foundation for Hope.</p><p>The heart of AkiraChix is the\n<a href=\"https://akirachix.com/programs/codeHive/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">codeHive</a> program: a one year,\nlive-in coding bootcamp for young adult women. The students live and learn on\nthe beautiful campus in the Nairobi district of Karen, learning about front-end\nweb development, dev-ops, distributed systems, game development, and more. All\naccommodation, tuition and food costs are covered.</p><p>When their training is completed they go off and work in industry (they cite an\n80% placement rate last year), but also come back to the campus to teach and\nsupport the next cohort.</p><p>We are lucky enough to speak to some of these young women. The students are\nquiet, polite, softly spoken, curious. The graduates are bold, outspoken,\nswitched-on. The difference is night and day, the transformation remarkable.</p><p>This is a lifeline in a world where tech roles tend to be inaccessible and\nintimidating to women, where girls are driven away from science, maths and\ncomputing and towards family, fashion and art. It's an endemic cultural problem\nin \"the west\" and even worse in many parts of Africa, where crippling poverty\nand inequality exacerbates the problem, chokes the pool of opportunity.</p><p>Maybe the proof is in the pudding. Long before we knew just what AkiraChix were\nup to here in Nairobi, we actually hired one of their graduates. Not for the\nsake of the mission, not to prove a point, not because someone asked us to:\nbecause she was just that good.</p><p>Speaking of pudding - I have to say, the food they served every day was\n<em>incredible</em>: colourful, varied, imaginative, playful. A range of dishes, each\nperfectly executed. I've never eaten better. Our Frank nearly went vegetarian.\nWe came from a dozen <em>major</em> cities across Europe and Africa and none of us\ncould shut up about how good the food in this place was.</p><p>The contrast between the luxury of AkiraChix and the shanty towns of Nairobi is\nstark. Kenya can be a Paradise. For me, in my privilege, it was - but I mean for\n<em>everyone</em>. By driving at this wedge of inequality, by empowering individuals,\ncivil society and governments with technology — really good, careful,\nconsiderate technology — they can chart their own futures.</p><p>Just like AkiraChix and Vijana Amani Pamoja are doing today.</p><p>The more we can enable organisations like these, the faster we get there. I\ncan't wait until my next family dinner in a healthier, safer, more equitable,\nand <em>even more</em> inspiring Kenya.</p><p>Tuko pamoja.</p><table><thead><tr><th align=\"center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Your writer in a silly hat\" src=\"/assets/images/kenya-joe-8b700cadde1b0fd10a3a3d67e18e25c5.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1686\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align=\"center\">Your writer in a silly hat</td></tr></tbody></table>",

Check out <a href=\"https://dominicanewsonline.com/news/homepage/news/press-release-for-world-immunization-week-open-solutions-for-health-delivers-again/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this press release</a> to learn more about the project supported by the <a href=\"https://www.paho.org/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)</a>.</p><p>DHIS2 offers robust dashboard and data visualization options, but St. Lucia’s immunization data was collected in a separate database, along with sensitive patient information that should only be accessed by authorized users. Therefore, to (i) avoid manual data entry and indicators calculations, and (ii) minimize access to sensitive patient data, OS4H sought to automate the reporting of key immunization indicators to DHIS2. After researching secure, open source, and OpenHIE-compliant options for data integration, OS4H decided to deliver this solution using the OpenFn workflow automation platform. </p><p><strong>In less than 1 month, OS4H successfully designed and implemented workflow automation on OpenFn that integrates the St. Lucia Health Information System (“SLUHIS”) database with DHIS2, enabling regular, nation-wide monitoring of key immunization indicators for MOH staff and epidemiologists.</strong></p><p>This OS4H implementation consisted of two phases: (1) training on the OpenFn platform and(2) implementation of the automated workflow for St. Lucia. </p><h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"os4h-is-now-a-certified-openfn-implementer\">OS4H is now a certified OpenFn implementer<a href=\"#os4h-is-now-a-certified-openfn-implementer\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to OS4H is now a certified OpenFn implementer\" title=\"Direct link to OS4H is now a certified OpenFn implementer\">​</a></h2><p>At OpenFn, we have a small implementation team that cannot meet the rising demand for workflow automation we’re seeing worldwide. Therefore, we are investing more in partner enablement to help develop the automation expertise and OpenFn implementation capacity of local IT teams solving local problems–like OS4H in the Caribbean. Earlier this year, our core team launched the OpenFn Implementation Partner Program to offer training on the OpenFn Digital Public Good, as well as on our implementation process. </p><p>To quickly learn how to implement OpenFn, the OS4H team completed the OpenFn Partner Onboarding Training to learn about the OpenFn product suite, as well as how to successfully design and deliver workflow automation implementations end-to-end. Over the course of 2 weeks, OS4H team members attended online training sessions and completed “homework” exercises to practice OpenFn fundamentals and prepare for their upcoming, real-world projects. At the end of the training, the OS4H team officially joined the <a href=\"https://community.openfn.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OpenFn Community</a>, received “OpenFn Essentials” badges for OpenFn administration and development, and were prepared to kick off their first implementation with the St. Lucia Ministry of Health.</p><blockquote><p>\"After adopting the OpenHIE reference architecture, we began exploring the various referenced technologies. Upon review of the interoperability layer technologies, <strong>we quickly appreciated the versatility and ease of use of OpenFn.</strong></p><p>When data transformation is needed, OpenFn utilizes JavaScript, a scripting language that is familiar to most developers in the Caribbean.

Historically, most of our revenue came from selling\nsoftware licenses and doing implementation work around a proprietary web\napplication built on top of the open-source OpenFn integration toolkit. We have\nreinvested our earned revenue over the years into the development of this free\nand open source (FOSS) toolkit. In recent years, since committing to making the\nnext version of our flagship product fully open-source, we’ve also received key\ngrants, donations, and pull requests to strengthen the toolkit and this next\nversion, OpenFn/Lightning, directly.</p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/img/sffh.png\" width=\"400\" class=\"img_ev3q\"><p>The <strong>Steele Foundation for Hope</strong> is a foundation that invests in lasting\nsolutions for some of humanity’s hardest challenges. They believe that advances\nfound through technology and innovation are key to improving quality of life for\nless fortunate people around the world. They share our vision for a diverse,\nthriving ICT4D sector with local ownership of solutions and distribution of\npower, and we are incredibly excited to have their backing for this next stage\nOpenFn’s growth.</p><h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"what-were-doing\">What we're doing<a href=\"#what-were-doing\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to What we're doing\" title=\"Direct link to What we're doing\">​</a></h2><p>Making our flagship product fully open-source is important to our long-term\nstrategy for impact at scale. Even when governments and NGOs choose a managed\nOpenFn offering, they need to know that they're not locked in. They've got to\nown their solution, and that means having the substantive freedom to implement,\ndeploy, run, maintain, or easily migrate off OpenFn when and however they want.</p><p>At the same time, customers running critical workflows on OpenFn only chose our\ntechnology in the first place because they're confident that it's well built,\nwell maintained, and isn't going anywhere anytime soon. In other words, they\nwant robust software that's supported by reliable businesses—in that sense, they\ndo not want us to do anything that might threaten the long-term sustainability\nof the company that built it.</p><p>Donor funding to enhance our open source software and documentation has been\nabsolutely pivotal to date, and we’ll continue to receive grant funding for\nthis, <strong>but the investment from the Steele Foundation allows us to do something\ndifferent.</strong> It allows us to expand key aspects of our <em>business</em> that may\nultimately help us reduce our reliance on donors and drastically expand the\nsocial impact of the free and open source digital public good we provide.</p><p>Two major initiatives that are already underway are a UX redesign focused on\nnew-user onboarding and the development of a new channel partner certification\nprogram. Through the latter, we've seen staff at two different partner\norganizations get certified and one has gone on to deliver an OpenFn\nimplementation with the Ministry of Health in St. Lucia, automating a vaccine\nreporting workflow involving DHIS2 and a custom ministry database.</p><h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"what-this-means-for-the-dpg\">What this means for the DPG<a href=\"#what-this-means-for-the-dpg\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to What this means for the DPG\" title=\"Direct link to What this means for the DPG\">​</a></h2><p>So what does an investment in Open Function Group mean for the future of the\nOpenFn DPG?</p><p>First, it means we have the ability to set and execute on a longer-term strategy\nfor the product—one that we feel will allow the impact of the DPG to grow\nexponentially by decoupling adoption from the growth of our own core team. A\nlarge portion of this investment will go directly into the design and\nimplementation of features in the Lightning code base, made in conversation with\nour open-source steering committee for the immediate benefit of the whole\ncommunity.</p><p>Second, we'll be able to back up that new product strategy with serious capacity\nbuilding and business generation initiatives that grow the implementer\nnetwork—this means that there will be more capable OpenFn implementers within\ngovernments, NGOs, and for-profit consultancies all over the world.</p><p>Finally, as we iterate on and improve our software-delivery-as-a-service\n(hosting, deployment, maintenance, support) model, we’ll achieve greater\nfinancial stability, safeguarding the continued development of the DPG for years\nto come.</p><h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"one-more-thing\">One more thing<a href=\"#one-more-thing\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to One more thing\" title=\"Direct link to One more thing\">​</a></h2><p>This is a significant moment for the OpenFn community. On behalf of the team at\nOpen Function Group, I want to thank all of our users, contributors,\nimplementers, and partners. Your work, and the hope that you put in ICT4D is why\nwe're doing what we're doing.</p><p>Whether you're a longtime forum user or are yet to make you first post on\n<a href=\"https://community.openfn.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">community.openfn.org</a>, now is the perfect time to\nmake some noise.</p><ul><li>Ask a question about the data model.

(OpenFn is only here\nbecause of <em>you</em> and the importance of your work.)</li></ul><p>Your use cases, workflows, adaptors, features, frustrations, feelings of\ndelight... they have driven the product forward for the last 9 years and we\ncan’t tell you how grateful we are for your continued support and willingness to\ncontribute.

For personal reasons,\nI didn’t really plan on being here long - but I thought I could help out for a\nwhile.</p><p>\"Hey,\" says CEO Taylor Downs, one winter’s morning. \"Do you want to come to Cape\nTown with us?\"</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Bo-Kaap\" src=\"/assets/images/bo-kaap-8ef429926bd7946d17c16fa737c9efd8.webp\" width=\"1462\" height=\"1097\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p><p>I am not well traveled - I’ve never left Europe, let alone stepped foot on\nAfrican soil. So I enthusiastically agree.</p><p>And I’m not the only one. Between us, we have traveled 40,000 miles to be in\nDistrict Six, Cape Town - from London, Dakar, Arusha, Riga, Nairobi. It has\ntaken us over 150 hours to get here.</p><p>Right now we are gathered around this table, in this hot little room, scribbling\nour truths onto this oversized piece of paper. We are, in our own little way,\ntrying to make the world a better place.</p><p>Suddenly the fan stops, the lights go out, the projector goes dark.</p><p>Load shedding just struck.</p><p>But the conversation doesn’t even waver. Eyes briefly flick to the light\nfixtures, but we remain focused on refining our mission, putting an edge on our\npurpose, comparing visions on how, where and when we can make a difference.</p><p>We have traveled all this way to figure out how to best work together.</p><p>If we don’t get this right, we can’t achieve our mission. We are digital nomads,\nspread throughout Europe, Africa and North America. We rarely meet in physical\nspace. Technology enables us to collaborate, but it brings its fair share of\nchallenges too.</p><p>\"Sitting down all day is <em>dangerous</em>,\" says Taylor. \"We have to make this\n<em>count</em>.\"</p><p>It has taken weeks of preparation and worry to get here. I’ve been arranging\ntravel, visas, domestic stuff, vaccinations. Since covid broke out, for three\nyears now, my partner and I have worked from home, in the same small flat,\nalways together. I fight back tears as we kiss goodbye on the doorstep, and\nstart my long journey.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Obligatory team photo\" src=\"/assets/images/team-cape-point-2a14bec98c59366e708d659af5e8f830.webp\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p><p>It's an overnight flight. I do not sleep. I hit Cape Town tarmac at 7am,\nscrabble for a data connection at 8am, collapse into Stu's car at 9am. I watch\nthe city, the townships, the shanty villages, the mountains; a new world drifts\nsilently past the window. The environment is beautiful, the poverty is\nheartbreaking.</p><p>In Simon’s Town, as I shake hands with my colleagues for the first time, we\nlearn things about each other that months of video conferencing could never\nreveal.</p><p>By the end of the first day I am already exhausted, overwhelmed, burned out from\nadrenaline.</p><p>Over the weekend, we walk, we swim, we kick a football, we drive, we eat, we\nimmerse ourselves in penguins (did you know Cape town has penguins?).</p><p>At an artistic retreat in Scarborough, we sculpt from clay, eyes closed, hands\nbusy, minds focused. A safe space, our guide tells us nervously, unsure how to\nbreak an ice that has suddenly formed in 30 degree heat.</p><p>It is at the same time austere and liberating, creative and claustrophobic,\nindividual and collective. We swap chairs and work on each other’s sculptures -\nnervously, at first, unwilling to do harm, but soon embracing the opportunity to\nco-imagine, to co-create.</p><p>In the end it is a joy from which, I think, we all emerged changed.</p><p>“It was a little too woo-woo for me”, says Taylor, tears still drying in his\neyes. It is the most reassuring thing I have heard in days.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Taylor, laughing in the face of danger\" src=\"/assets/images/taylor-baboons-44169681c781ecfe699ed852e88b1145.webp\" width=\"1170\" height=\"878\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p><p>Later, as the sun sets behind us, on a Cape Town beach, we share our stories.\nBetween us we barely have a single thing in common - be it language, religion,\neducation, gender, background, hobbies. But maybe, it emerges, there is one\nthing - just one slender thread - which connects us after all: a determination\nto fight inequality.</p><p>We are not righteous. We all know we can’t save the world. We are not in the\nbusiness of toppling regimes, redistributing wealth, healing the sick. We do not\nbear torches.</p><p>But we do have a contribution to make. Automation is our thing. We believe that\nwe can improve critical business processes in the “developing world” - the\nplaces that big tech doesn’t care about - by taking away tedium, building trust\nand transparency, and reducing errors.</p><p>In the office, unfazed by power cuts, we explore working practices, discuss\ncultural differences, deepen our respect.</p><p>We learn how to talk about and discuss our data integration technology -\nsomething so abstract that often even highly technical people don’t get it. We\nlearn how our technology helps the people Silicon Valley overlooks. We share\nstories, explore ideas, learn about ourselves and the business.</p><p>On the penultimate day, I find myself overwhelmed with grief.

All of the\ndata that was collected in the first three clinics were not accessible to her\ndoctor at the fourth one. At each clinic the same data was collected and doctors\nrelied on Mariam to provide her medical history. They asked about past visits,\nprevious diagnoses, prescriptions, lab results, etc. Her medical history was\nspread across paper and electronic systems, in her home, at different\npharmacies, and in labs.

That’s no surprise to us; it’s the fundamental premise of OpenFn.\nWhat’s expanded dramatically through our work in Cambodia, however, is our\ncollection of <em><strong>reusable processes</strong></em>—how to approach integration long before\nyou open up a computer—that can now serve as a template for future projects.</p><p>One such process is the “Integration Checklist”, a non-technical checklist that\nhelps organizations bring together relevant stakeholders and define the value\nand rules of an integration. This is no small thing. In the Primero post\nmentioned above, Jan Panchalingam, also a Child Protection Specialist at UNICEF,\nwrites that implementing OpenFn is “changing the way they work”.</p><p>The “aha” moment for those involved in this project was that the artifacts\nproduced in an OpenFn implementation—actual\n<a href=\"/documentation/build/triggers\">“triggers”</a> and\n<a href=\"/documentation/build/workflows\">“jobs”</a> written with and for the Open Source\nIntegration Toolkit—publicly memorialize the data sharing agreements between\npartners.</p><p>I want to stick with that for a moment: <strong>the implementation <em>is</em> the\nagreement!</strong></p><div class=\"theme-admonition theme-admonition-success alert alert--success admonition_LlT9\"><div class=\"admonitionHeading_tbUL\"><span class=\"admonitionIcon_kALy\"><svg viewBox=\"0 0 12 16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M6.5 0C3.48 0 1 2.19 1 5c0 .92.55 2.25 1 3 1.34 2.25 1.78 2.78 2 4v1h5v-1c.22-1.22.66-1.75 2-4 .45-.75 1-2.08 1-3 0-2.81-2.48-5-5.5-5zm3.64 7.48c-.25.44-.47.8-.67 1.11-.86 1.41-1.25 2.06-1.45 3.23-.02.05-.02.11-.02.17H5c0-.06 0-.13-.02-.17-.2-1.17-.59-1.83-1.45-3.23-.2-.31-.42-.67-.67-1.11C2.44 6.78 2 5.65 2 5c0-2.2 2.02-4 4.5-4 1.22 0 2.36.42 3.22 1.19C10.55 2.94 11 3.94 11 5c0 .66-.44 1.78-.86 2.48zM4 14h5c-.23 1.14-1.3 2-2.5 2s-2.27-.86-2.5-2z\"></path></svg></span>tip</div><div class=\"admonitionContent_S0QG\"><p>By <strong>operationalizing a data sharing agreement</strong> through OpenFn, these\norganizations now have machine-readable granularity, full revision history, and\nproof-of-processing for their contract.</p></div></div><p>A huge portion of the work required to make the case management systems\ninteroperable was done on calls, walking through different referral flows and\nprivacy requirements and getting buy-in from various stakeholders and legal\nentities. Now, the output of those crucial conversations are not just notes or a\nsigned MOU and careful task lists for system admins, they are a series of\nscripts that are stored and actually enacted, faithfully, automatically, and\nmany times every day by the OpenFn platform–automating data exchange between\npartner agencies.</p><p>By implementing OpenFn—defining the case referral process and the requirements\nof the agreement in machine-readable levels of specificity—they’ve actually\nremoved huge amounts of ambiguity and helped standardize the data sharing\nagreements between partner ministries/organizations.</p><p>And the reusability of these processes isn’t just theoretical. They are already\nbeing applied in three other big UNICEF implementations as we speak. The next to\ngo live will be in Thailand.</p><p>UNICEF and the Thai Ministry of Public Health are working to enable social\nprotection caseworkers using the Primero app to access relevant patient medical\nhistory securely, via OpenFn and a ministry-managed API gateway. By\nforegrounding the checklist, and making sure all the stakeholders in these\nsensitive data-sharing agreements are on board with the concept that this\nimplementation is a way of formalizing and enforcing data sharing agreements,\nthe teams have been able to move much more confidently through the initial\nprototyping process. At OpenFn, we plan to continue to build out the open source\nprocess documentation that goes alongside the software—making it easier for\nfolks everywhere to achieve durable interoperability and manifest their data\nsharing agreements.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"one-more-thing-on-the-subject-of-open-source\">One more thing.

On the subject of open source.\" title=\"Direct link to One more thing. On the subject of open source.\">​</a></h3><p><strong>Open source is about freedom of choice, not money.</strong></p><p>For the moment, in both Cambodia and Thailand, the implementations are running\non OpenFn.org—our proprietary cloud-hosted service—but in both cases they’re\nalready evaluating plans to migrate these implementations to make use of the\nFOSS-only deployment pathway we provide in the Open Source Integration Toolkit.</p><p>I think that’s hugely important. A cloud-hosted service might be the best option\nfor a given ministry during prototype, pilot, scale-up, or even national-scale\ndeployments—oftentimes they’re less expensive and more secure—<b><i>but for\nsystems as important as these, it’s absolutely critical that they’re not locked\nin.</i></b></p><p>Governments must be free to export that implementation and run it on completely\nopen source software that they can debug, on whatever servers they’d like, with\nsupport from whatever vendors they choose.</p><p>This is what recent investment in the Open Source Integration Toolkit, from\nDigital Square, the FCDO, DIAL, and our team here at OpenFn has made possible.\nFrom software, to documentation, to process and implementation guides like those\nmentioned above, the goal of the toolkit is to build up the integration\ncapability of the sector at large. Ultimately the toolkit will ensure that\nOpenFn implementations aren’t forever reliant on a single company. It will\nincrease the substantive freedom of governments to make long-term plans and take\nlong-term ownership of their integration solutions, without having to re-code\nthe wheel.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"to-take-action\">To take action<a href=\"#to-take-action\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to To take action\" title=\"Direct link to To take action\">​</a></h3><p>To join our community please sign up to our\n<a href=\"https://community.openfn.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">community page </a>and feel free to contribute and\nask questions on the forum.</p><p>If your organization is thinking about interoperability and would like to learn\nmore about OpenFn’s platform or open-source offerings please contact\n<a href=\"mailto:services@openfn.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">services@openfn.org</a> for a free consultation.</p><p>Also, be sure to stay tuned to our <a href=\"/blog\">blog</a>, or subscribe to our\n<a href=\"http://eepurl.com/hcOw8H\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">newsletter</a> to stay up to date with all ICT4D\nintegration related news.</p>",

OpenFn is proud to now be officially joining them on this list.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Bridge as public good\" src=\"/assets/images/george-washington-bridge-fce1acf242f369da8d24608e3b1470b1.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1279\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"the-imperative-for-digital-global-goods\">The imperative for digital global goods<a href=\"#the-imperative-for-digital-global-goods\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to The imperative for digital global goods\" title=\"Direct link to The imperative for digital global goods\">​</a></h3><p>The story of digital global goods began in July 2018 when the Secretary General\nof the United Nations convened a High-Level Panel on Digital Cooperation to\nstrengthen impact and better direct global efforts in the digital arena. What\nmotivated this panel’s formation was a growing awareness that as digital\ntechnology reshapes economies and society, it is imperative that the\ntechnologies deployed do not exacerbate global inequities, but instead seek to\naddress them.</p><p>Co-Chaired by Melinda Gates and Jack Ma, the panel’s\n<a href=\"https://digitalcooperation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DigitalCooperation-report-web-FINAL-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">final report</a>\nprovided recommendations for how the international community could work together\nto harness digital technologies for positive change. One of the key action items\nthat emerged in the report’s aftermath was a call for global investment into the\ncreation of <strong>digital public goods to help attain the sustainable development\ngoals. </strong>Specifically, availability and accessibility to digital public\ngoods—and the data they collect—was introduced as being essential to address\nissues of digital inclusion for all regardless of location, race, gender,\nreligion or socioeconomic standing.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"what-is-open-source\">What is open source?<a href=\"#what-is-open-source\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to What is open source?\" title=\"Direct link to What is open source?\">​</a></h3><p>Not all open source projects are digital public goods, but all digital public\ngoods must be open source. Open source software is code that is publicly\naccessible—anyone can see, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit. Many\ngovernments and international NGOs prefer open source software because of\ncustomization and data residency requirements. Since our founding in 2014 OpenFn\nhas been committed to open-source software development and the source code for\nmost of the products we’ve built is freely available on\n<a href=\"https://github.com/OpenFn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub</a>.</p><p>Notably, even though open source software is “free” the cost of deploying it and\nmaintaining it carries costs that are sometimes comparable to commercial\nsoftware licenses.\n<a href=\"https://digitalsquare.org/blog/2020/2/13/openness-and-value-in-the-digital-health-sector\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Digital Square </a>explains\nthis dynamic further: “The misconception of open source as ‘free’ may be better\nunderstood through the Romance languages. Open source is\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">libre, not gratis</a>: free as\nin speech, not as in lunch. In the case of many low resource settings, this is\nthe right kind of free. The need for adaptability is balanced by the ability to\nadapt a software.”</p><p>An example of a successful open source software project that is also classified\nas a digital public good is <a href=\"https://openlmis.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OpenLMIS</a>. OpenLMIS is the\nleading logistics system used to track health products across national supply\nchains and while they credit their open source approach as being responsible for\ntheir deployment success to date, they have also experienced challenges related\nto their business model. Business model challenges force open source project\nmaintainers like OpenLMIS and OpenFn to explore different types of revenue\nstreams that ensure long term sustainability of the projects.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"how-openfns-business-model-will-enable-long-term-sustainability-of-its-open-source-project\">How OpenFn’s business model will enable long term sustainability of its open source project<a href=\"#how-openfns-business-model-will-enable-long-term-sustainability-of-its-open-source-project\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to How OpenFn’s business model will enable long term sustainability of its open source project\" title=\"Direct link to How OpenFn’s business model will enable long term sustainability of its open source project\">​</a></h3><p>Historically, lacking grant funding and without outside investors, OpenFn\ndecided that the best way to continue delivering high-impact implementations and\nkeep a laser focus on the needs of real-world NGOs that we serve was to build a\nlicensed, closed-source software-as-a-service (SaaS) product offering (see\n<a href=\"http://www.openfn.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">openfn.org</a>). This product is dependent on the huge\nsuite of open-source software that we continue to invest in for the good of the\nlarger community—“core”, “adaptors”, and almost all of the software we build is\nopen source—but by licensing our SaaS we’ve been able to create a steady stream\nof revenue that is only dependent on real-world customers seeing and paying for\nthe value they get by using the product. Selling subscriptions to the OpenFn\nplatform has not only helped it grow into a strong, trusted, enterprise-grade\nproduct, but it has bootstrapped our implementation arm, subsidized our “free\nforever” enterprise tier, and funded the further development of our open source\ntools.</p><p>Thanks to recent support from DIAL, DFID and Digital Square, OpenFn is now able\nto invest more time and energy into our open-source tools—building new software\nto compete with and complement more directly our licensed platform and working\nto make the existing tools more accessible to a wider audience.The licensed\nplatform and our open source project have a symbiotic relationship with one\nanother. Open source innovation drives platform innovation and vice versa.\nCrucially, both rely on each other.</p><p>With a more robust <a href=\"/documentation/deploy/portability\">open source offering </a>and\na heavy investment in documentation, it will be easier than ever for\norganizations to get up and running with OpenFn and then choose whether they\nwant to scale their solutions on the platform or deploy them on their own\ninfrastructure using nothing but free open source software (FOSS).</p><p>Some will still choose to use our hosted offering, and we’ll be encouraged to\nfurther differentiate that offering through the value that it provides—<!-- -->_<!-- -->not\n<!-- -->_<!-- -->merely by virtue of it being proprietary. In fact, we see a future in which\nNGOs and governments may shift seamlessly between all of our tools. We’ve\ndeveloped them with exactly this in mind, ensuring zero lock-in despite the\nvarying licenses.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"what-does-this-mean-concretely\">What does this mean, concretely?<a href=\"#what-does-this-mean-concretely\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to What does this mean, concretely?\" title=\"Direct link to What does this mean, concretely?\">​</a></h3><p>In the past it was quite challenging to use OpenFn’s open source tools, and we\nfeel that they didn’t provide enough functionality, out-of-the-box, to our\nusers. It’s not surprising to find, then, that almost all of OpenFn’s users were\non the proprietary platform. Going forward our\n<a href=\"/documentation/deploy/options\">open source integration toolkit</a>, including\nOpenFn/devtools, OpenFn/core, OpenFn/engine, and OpenFn/microservice, will be\nmore robust, user friendly and accessible. This means that anyone, anywhere can\nbuild integration and automation solutions more quickly and interoperability\nsolutions will be within reach to organizations with varying technical\ncapabilities.</p><div class=\"theme-admonition theme-admonition-caution alert alert--warning admonition_LlT9\"><div class=\"admonitionHeading_tbUL\"><span class=\"admonitionIcon_kALy\"><svg viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M8.893 1.5c-.183-.31-.52-.5-.887-.5s-.703.19-.886.5L.138 13.499a.98.98 0 0 0 0 1.001c.193.31.53.501.886.501h13.964c.367 0 .704-.19.877-.5a1.03 1.03 0 0 0 .01-1.002L8.893 1.5zm.133 11.497H6.987v-2.003h2.039v2.003zm0-3.004H6.987V5.987h2.039v4.006z\"></path></svg></span>Microservice and devtools are being replaced by Lightning</div><div class=\"admonitionContent_S0QG\"><p>Please note that <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenFn/microservice\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OpenFn/microservice</a>\nand <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenFn/devtools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OpenFn/devtools</a> are being deprecated\nand replaced by <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenFn/lightning\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OpenFn/Lightning</a>, When\nlighting is released.</p></div></div><p>Versatility is a key component of our open source vision.

While our enterprise platform might\nbe right for your organization today, 5 years from now, once your organization\nhas its own dedicated IT team and server infrastructure, local deployment via\nmicroservice might make better sense. The good news is that OpenFn integration\n<a href=\"/documentation/deploy/portability\">portability</a> will make these transitions\neasy.

Because achieving\ninteroperability can be complex, OpenFn was brought into the consortium to offer\nexpert integration insights and to provide the digital infrastructure required\nto enable the program’s goals.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"the-systems-integrated\">The Systems Integrated<a href=\"#the-systems-integrated\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to The Systems Integrated\" title=\"Direct link to The Systems Integrated\">​</a></h3><p>The systems OpenFn integrated for the first phase of this project are\n<a href=\"https://www.primero.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Primero</a> and <a href=\"https://oscarhq.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OSCaR</a>. Primero\nis an open source software platform that helps social services, humanitarian and\ndevelopment workers manage protection-related data, with modules that facilitate\ncase management, incident monitoring and family tracing and reunification. OSCaR\n(Open Source Case-management and Record-keeping) is a case management software\nsystem that is used by civil society organizations in Cambodia to manage cases\nor children in residential care.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Primero OpenFn Oscar Diagram\" src=\"/assets/images/primero_oscar-164912ef651cecccb7b2e559986c3037.png\" width=\"1534\" height=\"694\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p><p>First a definition: “Interoperability”, in this context, is the automated\nability of computer systems to work in concert with (sharing data and\ncollaborating on processes with) other systems. Defining interoperability is the\neasy part; achieving it is another story. “In a complex, interagency project\nlike this, it’s true that the technologies in play often don’t ‘speak the same\nlanguage’, but neither do the partners,” writes Aleksa Krolls, OpenFn’s Head of\nServices. “Our job is not only to facilitate the flow of data between systems,\nbut to facilitate the process by which our partners—human users—communicate\nmeaning across multiple agencies and people.”</p><p>In this example, OpenFn’s software is acting as the “translator” between the\nOSCaR and Primero systems. OpenFn’s primary interoperability objective for this\nfirst phase was to facilitate Cambodian government partners and local\nnon-governmental organizations in systematic registration and tracking of\nchildren in Cambodia, including facilitating duplicate detection between systems\nand enabling easy-to-use processes for updating beneficiary/client details.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"the-work-is-just-beginning\">The work is just beginning<a href=\"#the-work-is-just-beginning\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to The work is just beginning\" title=\"Direct link to The work is just beginning\">​</a></h3><p>OpenFn’s work with UNICEF Cambodia and the MoSVY doesn’t end here though. We are\nnow beginning the process of enabling further Primero interoperability with\nsoftware like ProGres v2, UNHCR’s institutional tool, as well as enabling\nPrimero-to-Primero implementations in the field. We’ll be sure to keep the\ncommunity updated as the project progresses.</p><p>Many of the best responses to the critical issues we face as a society emerge\nfrom collaboration and interoperability enables collaboration in the digital\ndomain.

Small-scale farmers are feeding the\nworld, but a majority of them are in an endless cycle of poverty and lack access\nto traditional banks and financing. In this post, we highlight our partner\nmyAgro, an organization leveraging OpenFn automation to help scale its programs\ntowards its goal of serving 1 million farmers in 2025.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"myAgro\" src=\"/assets/images/myAgro1-2ca3797d21345de19cb745f98fe8e3d3.JPG\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"heres-the-overview\">Here's the overview.<a href=\"#heres-the-overview\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Here's the overview.\" title=\"Direct link to Here's the overview.\">​</a></h3><p><a href=\"https://www.myagro.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">myAgro</a> has pioneered an innovative bankless savings\nplan that allows thousands of farmers to finance themselves and invest their\nmoney in high-quality seeds, fertilizer, tools, and training. OpenFn automates\nmyAgro’s mobile layaway platform, powering a system where farmers can\nincrementally pay for agricultural inputs by purchasing savings vouchers in\nlocal stores—making deposits via SMS. myAgro holds those layaway payments until\nplanting time, when bulk purchases of seeds, fertilizers, and tools are\ndelivered to the farmers based on individualized plans.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"what-is-myagro\">What is myAgro?<a href=\"#what-is-myagro\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to What is myAgro?\" title=\"Direct link to What is myAgro?\">​</a></h3><p>myAgro helps thousands of farmers in Senegal and Mali save money for seed and\nfertilizer using what they already have—their mobile phone. With a mission to\nmove small-scale farmers out of poverty, myAgro leveraged OpenFn to develop a\nmobile layaway platform that connects their Telerivet SMS-based savings deposit\nsystem, Salesforce farmer tracking &amp; supply chain system, and CommCare\nbarcode-scanning mobile app.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"myagro\" src=\"/assets/images/farmers-9a9c1f15f22d45cc32159c1e47bd5a0e.jpg\" width=\"4234\" height=\"1468\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"using-excel-and-paper-to-manage-thousands-of-farmer-transactions\">Using Excel and paper to manage thousands of farmer transactions.<a href=\"#using-excel-and-paper-to-manage-thousands-of-farmer-transactions\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Using Excel and paper to manage thousands of farmer transactions.\" title=\"Direct link to Using Excel and paper to manage thousands of farmer transactions.\">​</a></h3><p>In 2014, myAgro utilized <a href=\"https://telerivet.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Telerivet</a>, an instant SMS and\nvoice platform, to capture farmer savings deposits, and paper to track voucher\nshipments. They would then regularly export the SMS data to an Excel\nspreadsheet, and manually match savings deposits against a database of vouchers\nbefore allocating credit to a farmer’s account and sending a confirmation SMS.\nStaff spent 1-2 hours per day (or 261+ hours per year) on this data\nreconciliation process, which had high potential for human error.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"where-openfn-comes-in\">Where OpenFn comes in...<a href=\"#where-openfn-comes-in\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Where OpenFn comes in...\" title=\"Direct link to Where OpenFn comes in...\">​</a></h3><p>OpenFn moved this entire manual process over to the cloud, automating the\nsavings deposit system and connecting a CommCare barcode-scanning mobile app for\nreal-time farmer order management and inventory tracking. By integrating\nTelerivet and Salesforce, myAgro no longer has to rely on data entries and\nuploads that would take 1-2 hours each day.</p><p>OpenFn now processes all SMS messages automatically, builds trust by providing\ninstant confirmation to farmers, and eliminates the chance of human error in\nsavings allocations. OpenFn helped myAgro transition from managing rows and\ncolumns of data in an Excel spreadsheet to an automated savings and inventory\ntracking system that enables real-time program monitoring.</p><ul><li>In 2014, myAgro serviced 14,000 farmers across 200 villages in Senegal and\nMali.</li><li>With the help of OpenFn, myAgro worked with 120,000 farmers in 2019, and plans\nto scale towards its goal of reaching <code>1 million farmers</code> by 2025.</li></ul><p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"myagro\" src=\"/assets/images/myagrograph-bf14565eddffbd2a30d7d8eede4b0f16.jpg\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1080\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p><p>Read more about myAgro’s mission <a href=\"https://www.myagro.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>, and stay tuned\nas myAgro continues to scale its OpenFn implementation.</p>",

Non-technical readers click away when they read the\nformer, while developers see the latter and think it’s nonsense! (i.e.,\nIntegration is NEVER trivial.) This doesn’t leave a lot of you left here on\nsentence number 5. Thanks for sticking it out, and let me reward your patience\nby explaining why this is such a big deal and what we need from you to make it\nhappen.</p><p>By leveraging technology, we can make social programs more effective. Bigger,\nbetter, more complete solutions to issues of poverty, public health, and human\nrights are not only possible, but seem to be right on our doorstep thanks to\ntremendous advances in information technology in the last 25 years. Thousands of\ntools have been developed to address all sorts of needs across international\ndevelopment. While the tools and use-cases vary tremendously, there’s always one\nugly, expensive, technically complex constant lurking in the background.</p><p>(Enter “integration” stage left.)</p><p>Just as “no man is an island”, no single piece of technology can stand alone. We\nrely on integrations every day. Many applications are so tightly integrated that\nwe hardly notice. Gmail and Google Contacts almost behave like a single app. If\nyou’re lucky, Gmail and your calendar are also integrated. If you sync a folder\non your computer to Dropbox, there’s a nifty integration between your local\noperating system and Dropbox.com. All of these integrations save precious time —\nthey cut out a tedious manual step like uploading a copy of each photo you save\non your computer to a website.</p><p>Now imagine running a pediatric HIV clinic in Kenya. Beyond email, a calendar,\nand Dropbox, you rely on a fingerprint scanner to to quickly access patient IDs,\na smart-phone based data collection app for new patient intake during home\nvisits, an electronic medical record system to manage patient data securely, and\nan automated SsocMS service to notify workers and patients of upcoming visits.</p><h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"we-should-take-a-moment-to-be-thankful-for-the-progress-weve-made-in-ict4d-its-amazing-that-these-technologies-exist-they-save-time-money-and-lives\">We should take a moment to be thankful for the progress we’ve made in “ICT4D”.

It’s amazing that these technologies exist. They save time, money, and lives.\">​</a></h4><p>The problem is that, for lack of a better metaphor, these technologies all speak\ndifferent languages. You can ask users to download data from one, make sense of\nit, and then upload it to another, but that’s a slow, expensive, and error-prone\ntask. (Not to mention the non-negligible fact that it’s horribly boring.) To get\nthe tos working together automatically you’re talking tens of thousands of\ndollars, and the integration you’re left with isn’t re-usable once your needs\nchange. What’s worse is that every time a new technology is implemented within\nan organization, consultants and developers must struggle anew to integrate it\nwith existing systems because there’s seldom the budget or foresight required to\nbuild a truly flexible and future-proof integration. This is the issue we’re\ntackling, head on.</p><h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"openfn-is-a-rosetta-stone-that-makes-automating-the-constant-flow-of-crucial-information-from-one-system-to-another-as-easy-as-point-and-click\">OpenFn is a “Rosetta Stone” that makes automating the constant flow of crucial information from one system to another as easy as point-and-click.<a href=\"#openfn-is-a-rosetta-stone-that-makes-automating-the-constant-flow-of-crucial-information-from-one-system-to-another-as-easy-as-point-and-click\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to OpenFn is a “Rosetta Stone” that makes automating the constant flow of crucial information from one system to another as easy as point-and-click.\" title=\"Direct link to OpenFn is a “Rosetta Stone” that makes automating the constant flow of crucial information from one system to another as easy as point-and-click.\">​</a></h4><p>Google.org called OpenFn’s attempt to provide easy and technology agnostic data\nintegration “the holy grail.” Stu, our own chief engineer had the same notion.\nAfter some hard work, it seems that the platform may really be that powerful,\nbut also far more attainable. Here’s how we do it:</p><p>We use (1) a universal standard for data storage, (2) standard information about\nwhat kinds of data are expected from “source applications” and “destination\napplications”, and (3) a user-friendly interface to generate “jobs”—sometimes\ncalled “automation scripts” or instructions for how to process data.</p><h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"a-job-might-be-to-create-a-new-patient-record-when-fingerprints-are-scanned-once-a-job-is-created-it-can-simply-be-switched-on-to-run-in-the-background-while-the-human-beings-at-your-organization-focus-on-much-more-important-and-interesting-things\">A job might be to create a new patient record when fingerprints are scanned. Once a job is created, it can simply be “switched on” to run in the background while the human beings at your organization focus on much more important (and interesting!) things.<a href=\"#a-job-might-be-to-create-a-new-patient-record-when-fingerprints-are-scanned-once-a-job-is-created-it-can-simply-be-switched-on-to-run-in-the-background-while-the-human-beings-at-your-organization-focus-on-much-more-important-and-interesting-things\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to A job might be to create a new patient record when fingerprints are scanned.

To integrate a new application,\na small adapter that translates data to JSON and provides a JSON-schema for your\ndatabase is all that’s required. Once one API connection to OpenFn is\nestablished, <strong><em>your technology is instantly connected to every other technology\nconnected to OpenFn–and OpenFn can connect any application.</em></strong> It will start to\nsnowball quickly, allowing data to flow instantly between hundreds of crucial\napplications, and each developer will only ever need to maintain a single\nconnection.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"apps\" src=\"/assets/images/apps-49baedba1e9bb9bdfc57016d05c8c453.png\" width=\"1036\" height=\"582\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p><p>Dozens of organizations worldwide use OpenFn to scale their interventions by\nautomating key processes and information flows. OpenFn solutions deliver\ncritical information, faster and unlock resources for organizations by\neliminating manual, time-intensive tasks. OpenFn connects any app–including\ncommon ICT4D tools like DHIS2, CommCare, Kobo Toolbox, and Salesforce, as well\nas databases, custom applications, and legacy systems. Drop us a note if you’re\nthinking about how to connect tools at your organization, or if you’re a\ndeveloper and wondering how to get your product connected to other essential\ntools in international development.</p><p>In the end, we’re talking about making it orders of magnitude faster and\nsignificantly less expensive to integrate key technologies. By automating the\nflow of data in social impact organizations we eliminate human error and reduce\nlag time—this means better information in the hands of decision makers, faster.\nAll this leads to one thing: bigger, better, and more complete solutions to some\nof the world's biggest problems.</p><p>If you’d just like some more information about OpenFn and how we help leading\nimpact-first organizations scale their interventions, head over to\n<a href=\"https://www.openfn.org/solutions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Solution Overviews - OpenFn.</a> To get all the\nlatest OpenFn updates, like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/openfn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facebook</a>\nand follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/openfn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Twitter.</a></p>",
