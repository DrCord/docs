## Overview

OpenFn.org provides a secure, stable, scalable cloud-hosted OpenFn offering that
provides a more economical option than local hosting. You can learn more about
our specific plans & offerings at
[openfn.org/pricing](https://www.openfn.org/pricing) and learn about billing
accounts and subscription management here.

## User Registration

When you create a cloud user account via [OpenFn.org](https://www.openfn.org/register), you are instantly
given access to a single project on the free tier and we create a personal
billing account (see [below](#billing-accounts)) which you can later use to
purchase additional project spaces or upgrade from the free plan.

If you've been invited to join OpenFn.org as a collaborator for another user's
project, you won't yet have your own personal billing account but may request
one by writing to [support@openfn.org](mailto:support@openfn.org).

## Billing Accounts

All projects _belong_ to a single billing account. The billing account houses
your:

- **Project Subscriptions** (your projects, each with their subscription);
- **Payment Methods** (credit cards & invoice payment methods); and
- **Billing Account Users** (the OpenFn users who can view or manage this
  billing account)

### Billing Account Users

By default, you are the owner of your own personal billing account. You can
invite other **managers** to add of modify payment methods and change the
subscription for a project. You can also add other **viewers** who can see the
project subscriptions in your account, the payment methods, and the other
billing account users but cannot modify any of them.

### Payment Methods

In order to upgrade your project subscription, you need an approved payment
method. Both invoice and credit card payment methods are allowed.

#### Invoice Payment

When you add an invoice payment method you must wait for it to be approved by
the OpenFn.org team before you can use it.

#### Credit Card Payment

When adding credit card payment methods, the card details will be verified by
Stripe.com immediately and you can upgrade you subscriptions right away.

## Plans & Limits

The full list of plans and limits are available at
[openfn.org/pricing](https://www.openfn.org/pricing).

### Upgrading your subscription

To upgrade you subscription:

1. Click "Subscription" from your project dashboard
2. Ensure that you have an approved payment method under the "Payment Methods"
   section.
3. Click "Manage Subscription"
4. Select a new plan and/or additional runs.
5. Review your subscription changes in the box at the bottom of the screen.
6. Click "Update subscription"

For upgrades, you will be billed immediately for the _difference_ between your
current plan and your new plan. At the end of your cycle, your next charge will
be only the cost of the new plan.

### Downgrading your subscription

For downgrades, you are allowed to continue using your current plan until your
cycle ends as you have already pre-paid for usage during that cycle. When the
cycle ends, the lower limits will be applied and your next charge will be for
the price of your new plan.
