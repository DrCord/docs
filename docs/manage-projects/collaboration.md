A user with one of the owner, admin or editor roles in a project can invite new
collaborators to their OpenFn project through the project `Settings` page.
Currently the invited user has to have an OpenFn account already to be able to
be invited as collaborator. New users can request an account
[here](https://www.openfn.org/register).

email that is already registered as a user on OpenFn.

collaborators tab and click the Add new collaborator button. From the settings
page, follow the steps below: Click on `Add Collaborator(s`) Provide the email
address of the user and select the Role (see options above) Add more
collaborators by clicking the “Add Additional Collaborator” button Save your
